Transitioning into NatureTech has introduced me to a range of new and complex challenges, but I find an interesting symmetry between my past and present. Our team at [Revalue](https://revalue.earth/) is deeply multidisciplinary, spanning software engineering, geospatial analysis, ecology, social science, and economics. Our team is charting new territory at the intersection of all these fields. Amidst the myriad complexities, one common thread has emerged - the deep need among domain experts to do things "the right way".

This drive comes from a good place. Mistakes, maintenance burdens, and professional criticism all stem from cutting corners. Many of our domain experts, often from top-tier professional backgrounds, have cultivated a culture of craftsmanship and rigour. Doing things the wrong way leads to real pain, and they have all felt it in the past.

But as any engineering leader with some experience under their belt will tell you - the obsessive pursuit of perfection often spirals into waste and inaction. Companies miss their window for impact, spending precious runway chasing an elusive ideal. Engineering teams polish products that don't solve real needs. Scientists accustomed to academia often struggle to adapt to the pace of the industry.

Entire books have been written about why it's better to build the right thing the wrong way than the wrong thing the right way. As engineering managers, we've seen teams spend months gold-plating features no one uses. Moving from academia to industry, many scientists are dismayed to find that invalidating a method is no longer considered a success - either it works, or it doesn't, and if it doesnâ€™t, your job is to pivot away from this line of research and find one that does.

Our vision at Revalue, to see nature regenerated at a planetary scale, is predicated on successfully avoiding deforestation where it happens and foresting as much as possible. Achieving this requires efficiently validating project ideas, killing the unrealistic ones to focus on those with real potential. How many dead ends we hit doesn't matter - what counts is how many viable projects we steward into being.

This is where the power of sufficiency comes in. As leaders, our role is to help domain experts identify the minimum viable level of effort to validate an idea and reach the next phase. We often teach software developers about "lean code", but neglect the more important concept of a "lean solution."

Lean code eschews documentation and testing - and inevitably creates technical debt. But a lean solution tightly scopes our work to what's needed to validate an idea and guide the next iteration. This requires engineers to collaborate closely with stakeholders to identify the key decision points where the team determines whether to stay the course or pivot.

The same principle applies in science - at what point does additional rigour become over-analysis? What depth of assessment is needed to support a key decision? Can we map a sequence of analyses to de-risk a project at each stage?

Over the past year, this has been our focus. Developing a robust methodology and the technology necessary to scale it to efficiently assess a carbon project's value, viability, feasibility, and path to commercialisation. By tightly defining the decision points and analyses required to validate each phase, we can quickly filter out low-potential projects with minimal waste. This enables our lean team to evaluate more projects and strategically allocate resources across workstreams.

This might seem easy from the outside, but doing so while maintaining the level of rigour necessary to retain both our scientific and commercial integrity required a feat of multidisciplinary collaboration rarely seen in other industries.

As a longtime tech leader, I've been struck by the parallels between how scientists and product engineers approach their work. Even more exciting is seeing how many hard-won lessons in managing engineering teams translate powerfully to other domains. While the details may differ, the core challenge is the same - harnessing expertise to rapidly deliver real-world impact through structured cycles of validation. By relentlessly asking ourselves, "What is sufficient?", we can channel deep knowledge to solve huge problems.
